# Exploring CI/CD with a Profile README.md

[Profile READMEs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-profile/managing-your-profile-readme) are a fun easter egg on GitHub. If you create a
repository on your personal account, with the same name as your username,
the `README.md` in this repository will be displayed on your profile page.

Here's [an example](https://github.com/bcoe/bcoe).

In this hands on lab, we explore the topic of CI/CD using
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) and your Profile README.md.
